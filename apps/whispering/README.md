Whispering is an open-source speech-to-text application. Press a keyboard shortcut, speak, and your words will transcribe, transform, then copy and paste at the cursor.

I really like hands-free voice dictation. For years, I relied on transcription tools that were _almost_ good, but they were all closed-source. Even those claiming to be "local" or "on-device" were still black boxes that left me wondering where my audio really went.

So I built Whispering. It's open-source, local-first, and most importantly, transparent with your data. ​​Your data is stored locally on your device, and your audio goes directly from your machine to a local provider (Whisper C++, Speaches, etc.) or your chosen cloud provider (Groq, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.) without any middleman or vendor lock-in. For me, the features were good enough that I left my paid tools behind (I used Superwhisper and Wispr Flow before).

Productivity apps should be open-source and transparent with your data, but they also need to match the UX of paid, closed-software alternatives. I hope Whispering is near that point. I use it for several hours a day, from coding to thinking out loud while carrying pizza boxes back from the office.

> [!TIP]
> Whispering is designed for quick transcriptions, not long recordings. For extended recording sessions, use a dedicated recording app.

> [!NOTE]
> The terms **Epicenter Whispering** and **Whispering** are interchangeable and refer to the same app.
>
> - _Epicenter Whispering_ emphasizes the app's place in the larger ecosystem.
> - _Whispering_ may be used for brevity and/or to focus on the standalone app.

Here's an overview:

<div align="center">

  </a>
  <p><em>Click to watch: Complete setup and usage guide (5 min)</em></p>
  <p><em>Note: We recently added support for Whisper C++, which isn't included in the video. For setup, see the docs below.</em></p>
</div>

and [here's how I personally am using it with Claude Code these days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpix588SeiQ).

There are plenty of transcription apps out there, each with their own strengths. Whispering has a few tricks up its sleeve, like a voice-activated mode for truly hands-free operation (no button holding), and customizable AI transformations with any prompt/model. The space is full of great ideas, but I just wanted to add some extra competition from the OSS ecosystem.

Built with Svelte 5 and Tauri, so it's tiny (~22MB) and starts instantly. The codebase is well-documented and designed to be understood and audited. That way, you know where your audio goes, how it's processed, and what data is stored. And finally, the cost savings. When you cut out the middleman, you pay providers directly:

| Service                           | Cost per Hour | Light Use (20 min/day) | Moderate Use (1 hr/day) | Heavy Use (3 hr/day) | Traditional Tools |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| `whisper-large-v3-turbo` (Groq)   | $0.04         | $0.40/month            | $1.20/month             | $3.60/month          | $15-30/month      |
| `whisper-large-v3` (Groq)         | $0.111        | $1.11/month            | $3.33/month             | $9.99/month          | $15-30/month      |
| `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` (OpenAI) | $0.18         | $1.80/month            | $5.40/month             | $16.20/month         | $15-30/month      |
| Local                             | $0.00         | $0.00/month            | $0.00/month             | $0.00/month          | $15-30/month      |

We're hoping that together in the open-source, local-first community, we can build something better than any closed-source alternative. The code is open-source because I believe that fundamental tools shouldn't require trusting a black box. Companies pivot, get acquired, or shut down. But open source is forever. ❤️

<summary><strong>🤖 AI-Powered Transformations</strong></summary>

Transform your transcriptions automatically with custom AI workflows:

**Quick Example: Format Text**

1. Go to **Transformations** (📚) in the top bar
2. Click "Create Transformation" → Name it "Format Text"
3. Add a **Prompt Transform** step:
   - Model: `Claude Sonnet 3.5` (or your preferred AI)
   - System prompt: `You are an intelligent text formatter specializing in cleaning up transcribed speech. Your task is to transform raw transcribed text into well-formatted, readable content while maintaining the speaker's original intent and voice.

Core Principles:

1. Preserve authenticity: Keep the original wording and phrasing as much as possible
2. Add clarity: Make intelligent corrections only where needed for comprehension
3. Enhance readability: Apply proper formatting, punctuation, and structure

Formatting Guidelines:

Punctuation & Grammar:

- Add appropriate punctuation (periods, commas, question marks)
- Correct obvious transcription errors while preserving speaking style
- Fix run-on sentences by adding natural breaks
- Maintain conversational tone and personal speaking patterns

Structure & Organization:

- Create paragraph breaks at natural topic transitions
- Use bullet points or numbered lists when the speaker is listing items
- Add headings if the content has clear sections
- Preserve emphasis through italics or bold when the speaker stresses words

Intelligent Corrections:

- Fix homophones (e.g., "there/their/they're")
- Complete interrupted thoughts when the intention is clear
- Remove excessive filler words (um, uh) unless they add meaning
- Correct obvious misspeaks while noting significant ones in [brackets]

Special Handling:

- Technical terms: Research and correct spelling if unclear
- Names/places: Make best guess and mark uncertain ones with [?]
- Numbers: Convert spoken numbers to digits when appropriate
- Time references: Standardize format (e.g., "3 PM" not "three in the afternoon")

Preserve Original Intent:

- Keep colloquialisms and regional expressions
- Maintain the speaker's level of formality
- Don't "upgrade" simple language to sound more sophisticated
- Preserve humor, sarcasm, and emotional tone

Output Format:
Return the formatted text with:

- Clear paragraph breaks
- Proper punctuation and capitalization
- Any structural elements (lists, headings) that improve clarity
- [Bracketed notes] for unclear sections or editorial decisions
- Original meaning and voice intact

Remember: You're a translator from spoken to written form, not an editor trying to improve the content. Make it readable while keeping it real.`

- User prompt: `Here is the text to format:

<text>{{input}}</text>` 4. Save and select it in your recording settings

**What can transformations do?**

- Fix grammar and punctuation automatically
- Translate to other languages
- Convert casual speech to professional writing
- Create summaries or bullet points
- Remove filler words ("um", "uh")
- Chain multiple steps together

**Example workflow:** Speech → Transcribe → Fix Grammar → Translate to Spanish → Copy to clipboard

## How is my data stored?

Whispering stores as much data as possible locally on your device, including recordings and text transcriptions. This approach ensures maximum privacy and data security. Here's an overview of how data is handled:

1. **Local Storage**: Voice recordings and transcriptions are stored in IndexedDB, which is used as blob storage and a place to store all of your data like text and transcriptions.

2. **Transcription Service**: The only data sent elsewhere is your recording to an external transcription service—if you choose one. You have the following options:
   - External services like OpenAI, Groq, or ElevenLabs (with your own API keys)
   - A local transcription service such as Speaches, which keeps everything on-device

3. **Transformation Service (Optional)**: Whispering includes configurable transformation settings that allow you to pipe transcription output into custom transformation flows. These flows can leverage:
   - External Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, or Groq's Llama models
   - Hosted LLMs within your custom workflows for advanced text processing
   - Simple find-and-replace operations for basic text modifications

   When using AI-powered transformations, your transcribed text is sent to your chosen LLM provider using your own API key. All transformation configurations, including prompts and step sequences, are stored locally in your settings.

You can change both the transcription and transformation services in the settings to ensure maximum local functionality and privacy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this different from other transcription apps?

Most apps are middlemen charging $30/month for API calls that cost pennies. With Whispering, you bring your own API key and pay providers directly. Your audio goes straight from your device to the API. No servers in between, no data collection, no subscriptions.

I built this for myself and use it every day. The code is open source so you can verify exactly what it does.

### What's it built with?

Svelte 5 + Tauri. The app is tiny (~22MB), starts instantly, and uses minimal resources. The codebase is clean and well-documented if you want to learn or contribute.

### Can I use it offline?

Yes, use the Speaches provider for local transcription. No internet, no API keys, completely private.

### How much does it actually cost?

With Groq (my favorite): $0.02-$0.06/hour. With OpenAI: $0.18-$0.36/hour. Local transcription: free forever. I use it several hours daily and pay about $3/month total.

### Is it really private?

Your recordings stay on your device in IndexedDB. When you transcribe, audio goes directly to your chosen provider using your API key. No middleman servers. For maximum privacy, use local transcription.

Note: we use anonymized event logging with [Aptabase](https://github.com/aptabase/aptabase), an open-source, privacy-first analytics service. No personal data is attached to any of these events. You can see exactly what events we log [in `analytics/types.ts`](https://github.com/epicenter-md/epicenter/blob/main/apps/whispering/src/lib/services/analytics/types.ts) and where they are logged [by searching for `rpc.analytics.logEvent` in our codebase](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aepicenter-md%2Fepicenter+rpc.analytics.logEvent&type=code). You can turn this off in settings at any time.

### Can I format the output automatically?

Yes - set up AI transformations to fix grammar, translate languages, or reformat text. Works with any LLM provider.

### What platforms work?

Desktop: Mac (Intel & Apple Silicon), Windows, Linux. Web: Any modern browser at [whispering.epicenter.so](https://whispering.epicenter.so).

### Found a bug?

Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter/issues). I actively maintain this and respond quickly.

### Architecture Overview

Whispering uses a clean three-layer architecture with 97% code sharing between desktop and web versions:

- **Service Layer**: Platform-agnostic business logic with Result types
- **Query Layer**: Reactive data management with caching
- **UI Layer**: Clean Svelte 5 components with minimal logic

The architecture achieves extensive code reuse through build-time platform detection, allowing the same codebase to run natively on desktop (via Tauri) and in the browser.

**→ For developers:** See the detailed [Architecture Deep Dive](./ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand how everything fits together.

### Run Whispering in Local Development Mode

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd epicenter`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `bun i`

To run the desktop app and website:

```bash
cd apps/whispering
bun tauri dev
```

### Build The Executable Yourself

If you have concerns about the installers or want more control, you can build the executable yourself. This requires more setup, but it ensures that you are running the code you expect. Such is the beauty of open-source software!

#### Desktop

```bash
cd apps/whispering
bun i
bun tauri build
```

Find the executable in `apps/whispering/target/release`

### Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whispering is built with care and attention to clean, maintainable code.

#### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow existing TypeScript and Svelte patterns throughout
- Use Result types from the [WellCrafted library](https://github.com/wellcrafted-dev/wellcrafted) for all error handling
- Follow WellCrafted best practices: explicit errors with `Result<T, E>`, structured `TaggedError` objects, and comprehensive error context
- Study the existing patterns in these key directories:
  - **[Services Architecture](./src/lib/services/README.md)** - Platform-agnostic business logic
  - **[Query Layer Patterns](./src/lib/query/README.md)** - RPC pattern and reactive state
  - **[Constants Organization](./src/lib/constants/README.md)** - Type-safe configuration

#### Contributing New Adapters

We'd love to expand Whispering's capabilities with more transcription and AI service adapters! Here's how to add a new adapter:

**Overview of the adapter system:**

1. **Transcription services** (`services/transcription/`): Convert audio to text
2. **Completion services** (`services/completion/`): Power AI transformations in the transformation pipeline
3. **Query layer** (`query/`): Provides reactive state management and runtime dependency injection
4. **Settings layer**: Stores API keys and user preferences

##### Adding a Transcription Service Adapter

Adding a new transcription service involves four main steps:

1. **Create the service implementation** in `src/lib/services/transcription/`:

   ```typescript
   // src/lib/services/transcription/your-service.ts
   import { WhisperingErr, type WhisperingError } from '$lib/result';
   import type { Settings } from '$lib/settings';
   import { Err, Ok, tryAsync, type Result } from 'wellcrafted/result';

   // Define your models directly in the service file
   export const YOUR_SERVICE_MODELS = [
   	{
   		name: 'model-v1',
   		description: 'Description of what makes this model special',
   		cost: '$0.XX/hour',
   	},
   	{
   		name: 'model-v2',
   		description: 'A faster variant with different trade-offs',
   		cost: '$0.YY/hour',
   	},
   ] as const;

   export type YourServiceModel = (typeof YOUR_SERVICE_MODELS)[number];

   export function createYourServiceTranscriptionService() {
   	return {
   		async transcribe(
   			audioBlob: Blob,
   			options: {
   				prompt: string;
   				temperature: string;
   				outputLanguage: Settings['transcription.outputLanguage'];
   				apiKey: string;
   				modelName: (string & {}) | YourServiceModel['name'];
   				// Add any service-specific options
   			},
   		): Promise<Result<string, WhisperingError>> {
   			// Validate API key
   			if (!options.apiKey) {
   				return WhisperingErr({
   					title: '🔑 API Key Required',
   					description: 'Please enter your YourService API key in settings.',
   					action: {
   						type: 'link',
   						label: 'Add API key',
   						href: '/settings/transcription',
   					},
   				});
   			}

   			// Make the API call
   			const { data, error } = await tryAsync({
   				try: () => yourServiceClient.transcribe(audioBlob, options),
   				catch: (error) =>
   					WhisperingErr({
   						title: '❌ Transcription Failed',
   						description: error.message,
   						action: { type: 'more-details', error },
   					}),
   			});

   			if (error) return Err(error);
   			return Ok(data.text.trim());
   		},
   	};
   }

   export const YourServiceTranscriptionServiceLive =
   	createYourServiceTranscriptionService();
   ```

   Don't forget to export your service in `src/lib/services/transcription/index.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import { YourServiceTranscriptionServiceLive } from './your-service';

   export {
   	// ... existing exports
   	YourServiceTranscriptionServiceLive as yourservice,
   };
   ```

   And add the API key field to the settings schema in `src/lib/settings/settings.ts`:

   ```typescript
   'apiKeys.yourservice': z.string().default(''),
   ```

2. **Update the service configuration** in `src/lib/constants/transcription/service-config.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import { YourServiceIcon } from '@lucide/svelte';
   import {
     YOUR_SERVICE_MODELS,
     type YourServiceModel,
   } from '$lib/services/transcription/your-service';

   // Add to the imports at the top
   type TranscriptionModel = OpenAIModel | GroqModel | ElevenLabsModel | YourServiceModel;

   // Add to TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE_IDS
   export const TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE_IDS = [
     'OpenAI',
     'Groq',
     'speaches',
     'ElevenLabs',
     'YourService', // Add here
   ] as const;

   // Add to TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICES array
   {
     id: 'YourService',
     name: 'Your Service Name',
     icon: YourServiceIcon,
     models: YOUR_SERVICE_MODELS,
     defaultModel: YOUR_SERVICE_MODELS[0],
     modelSettingKey: 'transcription.yourservice.model',
     apiKeyField: 'apiKeys.yourservice',
     type: 'api',
   }
   ```

3. **Wire up the query layer** in `src/lib/query/transcription.ts`:

   ```typescript
   // Add to the switch statement in transcribeBlob function
   case 'YourService':
     return services.transcriptions.yourservice.transcribe(blob, {
       outputLanguage: settings.value['transcription.outputLanguage'],
       prompt: settings.value['transcription.prompt'],
       temperature: settings.value['transcription.temperature'],
       apiKey: settings.value['apiKeys.yourservice'],
       modelName: settings.value['transcription.yourservice.model'],
     });
   ```

4. **Update the settings UI** in `src/routes/(config)/settings/transcription/+page.svelte`:

   ```svelte
   <!-- Add after other service conditionals -->
   {:else if settings.value['transcription.selectedTranscriptionService'] === 'YourService'}
     <LabeledSelect
       id="yourservice-model"
       label="YourService Model"
       items={YOUR_SERVICE_MODELS.map((model) => ({
         value: model.name,
         label: model.name,
         ...model,
       }))}
       bind:selected={
         () => settings.value['transcription.yourservice.model'],
         (selected) => settings.updateKey('transcription.yourservice.model', selected)
       }
       renderOption={renderModelOption}
     />
     <YourServiceApiKeyInput />
   {/if}
   ```

   Create the API key input component in `src/lib/components/settings/api-key-inputs/YourServiceApiKeyInput.svelte`:

   ```svelte
   <script lang="ts">
   	import { LabeledInput } from '$lib/components/labeled/index.js';
   	import { Button } from '$lib/components/ui/button/index.js';
   	import { settings } from '$lib/stores/settings.svelte';
   </script>

   <LabeledInput
   	id="yourservice-api-key"
   	label="YourService API Key"
   	type="password"
   	placeholder="Your YourService API Key"
   	value={settings.value['apiKeys.yourservice']}
   	oninput={({ currentTarget: { value } }) => {
   		settings.updateKey('apiKeys.yourservice', value);
   	}}
   >
   	{#snippet description()}
   		<p class="text-muted-foreground text-sm">
   			You can find your YourService API key in your <Link
   				href="https://yourservice.com/api-keys"
   				target="_blank"
   				rel="noopener noreferrer"
   			>
   				YourService dashboard
   			</Link>.
   		</p>
   	{/snippet}
   </LabeledInput>
   ```

   And export it from `src/lib/components/settings/index.ts`:

   ```typescript
   export { default as YourServiceApiKeyInput } from './api-key-inputs/YourServiceApiKeyInput.svelte';
   ```

   Also update `src/lib/constants/transcription/index.ts` to re-export your models:

   ```typescript
   export {
   	YOUR_SERVICE_MODELS,
   	type YourServiceModel,
   } from '$lib/services/transcription/your-service';
   ```

##### Adding an AI Transformation Adapter

AI transformations in Whispering use completion services that can be integrated into transformation workflows. Here's how to add a new AI provider:

1. **Create the completion service** in `src/lib/services/completion/`:

   ```typescript
   // src/lib/services/completion/your-provider.ts
   import { WhisperingErr, type WhisperingError } from '$lib/result';
   import { Err, Ok, tryAsync, type Result } from 'wellcrafted/result';

   export function createYourProviderCompletionService() {
   	return {
   		async complete(options: {
   			apiKey: string;
   			model: string;
   			systemPrompt: string;
   			userPrompt: string;
   			temperature?: number;
   		}): Promise<Result<string, WhisperingError>> {
   			// Validate API key
   			if (!options.apiKey) {
   				return WhisperingErr({
   					title: '🔑 API Key Required',
   					description: 'Please add your YourProvider API key.',
   				});
   			}

   			// Make the completion request
   			const { data, error } = await tryAsync({
   				try: () => yourProviderClient.complete(options),
   				catch: (error) =>
   					WhisperingErr({
   						title: '❌ Completion Failed',
   						description: error.message,
   						action: { type: 'more-details', error },
   					}),
   			});

   			if (error) return Err(error);
   			return Ok(data.text);
   		},
   	};
   }

   export const YourProviderCompletionServiceLive =
   	createYourProviderCompletionService();
   ```

2. **Register the service** in `src/lib/services/completion/index.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import { YourProviderCompletionServiceLive } from './your-provider';

   export {
   	// ... existing exports
   	YourProviderCompletionServiceLive as yourprovider,
   };
   ```

3. **Wire up the transformation handler** in `src/lib/query/transformer.ts`:

   ```typescript
   // Add a new case in the handleStep function's prompt_transform switch statement
   case 'YourProvider': {
     const { data: completionResponse, error: completionError } =
       await services.completions.yourprovider.complete({
         apiKey: settings.value['apiKeys.yourprovider'],
         model: step['prompt_transform.inference.provider.YourProvider.model'],
         systemPrompt,
         userPrompt,
       });

     if (completionError) {
       return Err(completionError.message);
     }

     return Ok(completionResponse);
   }
   ```

4. **Add API key to settings** in `src/lib/settings/settings.ts`:

   ```typescript
   'apiKeys.yourprovider': z.string().default(''),
   ```

5. **Update transformation types** to include your provider models and configuration

##### Error Handling Best Practices

Always use the `WhisperingErr` helper for user-facing errors:

```typescript
// Good: User-friendly error with action
return WhisperingErr({
	title: '⏱️ Rate Limit Reached',
	description: 'Too many requests. Please try again in a few minutes.',
	action: {
		type: 'link',
		label: 'View rate limits',
		href: 'https://yourservice.com/rate-limits',
	},
});

// Handle different error types
if (error.status === 401) {
	return WhisperingErr({
		title: '🔑 Invalid API Key',
		description: 'Your API key appears to be invalid or expired.',
		action: {
			type: 'link',
			label: 'Update API key',
			href: '/settings/transcription',
		},
	});
}

// Use with tryAsync for automatic error mapping
const { data, error } = await tryAsync({
	try: () => apiClient.makeRequest(),
	catch: (error) =>
		WhisperingErr({
			title: '❌ Request Failed',
			description: error.message,
			action: { type: 'more-details', error },
		}),
});
```

##### Testing Your Adapter

Create a test file alongside your service:

```typescript
// src/lib/services/transcription/your-service.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { createYourServiceTranscriptionService } from './your-service';

describe('YourService Transcription', () => {
	it('should handle missing API key', async () => {
		const service = createYourServiceTranscriptionService();
		const result = await service.transcribe(new Blob(), {
			apiKey: '',
			// other options
		});

		expect(result.error).toBeDefined();
		expect(result.error?.title).toContain('API Key Required');
	});

	// Add more tests
});
```

##### Example PR Structure

When submitting a PR for a new adapter, include:

- The service implementation with comprehensive error handling
- All type definitions and constants
- Query layer integration
- Settings UI components
- Tests covering success and error cases

### Local Transcription

Whispering's local transcription capabilities are powered by amazing open-source projects:

- **[transcribe-rs](https://github.com/cjpais/transcribe-rs)** by [CJ Pais](https://github.com/cjpais) - A unified Rust library providing abstraction over multiple speech-to-text engines (Whisper and Parakeet). This library enables Whispering to seamlessly support different transcription engines with a consistent API.

- **[Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/handy)** by [CJ Pais](https://github.com/cjpais) - The original project that birthed `transcribe-rs`. Handy is a an awesome cross-platform desktop speech-to-text application, and I personally use it especially when developing Whispering locally.

- **[whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)** by Georgi Gerganov - High-performance C/C++ port of OpenAI's Whisper model that makes local transcription fast and efficient.

Special thanks to [CJ Pais](https://github.com/cjpais) for creating and maintaining essential libraries that make local, privacy-preserving transcription possible in Whispering.
