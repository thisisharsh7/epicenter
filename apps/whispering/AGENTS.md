# Whispering App

Tauri + Svelte 5 desktop/web app for voice transcription.

## Key Points

- Three-layer architecture: Service → Query → UI
- Services are pure functions returning `Result<T, E>`
- Platform detection at build time via `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`
- Query layer handles reactivity, caching, and error transformation
- See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed patterns

## Don'ts

- Don't put business logic in Svelte components
- Don't access settings directly in services (pass as parameters)
- Don't use try-catch; use wellcrafted Result types

## Specs

App-specific specs live in `./specs/`. Cross-cutting specs go in `/docs/specs/`.
