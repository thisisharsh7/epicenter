# Remove v7.7.0 Migration Code

**Date**: 2025-11-29
**Status**: Complete

## Context

The codebase has migration code that was added to migrate model paths from old directory structures to new ones. This migration was marked with TODO comments to be removed after v7.7.0, as by that point most users would have upgraded and had the migration run.

The repository is now at v7.7.0 or later, so this migration code can be safely removed.

## TODOs Found

From `apps/whispering/src/routes/(app)/_layout-utils/migration.ts`:
- Line 4: "TODO: Remove this entire file after v7.7.0 release"
- Line 22: "TODO: Remove this function in v7.7.0 or later"

## Changes Required

### 1. Delete migration.ts
- [x] Delete `apps/whispering/src/routes/(app)/_layout-utils/migration.ts`

### 2. Update AppLayout.svelte
- [x] Remove import: `import { migrateModelPaths } from '../_layout-utils/migration';`
- [x] Remove comment: `// Run one-time migrations before other operations`
- [x] Remove call: `await migrateModelPaths();`

### 3. Verify No Other References
- [x] Search codebase for any other references to `migrateModelPaths`

## Review

The migration code was responsible for:
1. Moving `{appDataDir}/whispering/models` -> `{appDataDir}/models`
2. Moving `{appDataDir}/whisper-models` -> `{appDataDir}/models/whisper`
3. Moving `{appDataDir}/parakeet-models` -> `{appDataDir}/models/parakeet`

This was a one-time migration that ran at app startup for Tauri desktop users. Since most users have now upgraded past v7.7.0, the migration has served its purpose and can be removed to reduce code complexity.
