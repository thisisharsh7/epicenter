# The Surprising Truth About "Last Write Wins" in CRDTs

If you're using a CRDT library like Yjs, Automerge, or similar, you might assume "Last Write Wins" means the person who saved _last_ wins. That's intuitive, right?

**Wrong.** And this surprised me too.

## The Setup

You have a collaborative app. Two users edit the same field:

- Alice edits at 2:00pm: `title = "Draft"`
- Bob edits at 3:00pm: `title = "Final"`

They sync. What does everyone see?

If you said "Final" because Bob edited later... you'd be wrong about 50% of the time.

## What Actually Happens

Most CRDT libraries (like Yjs, the backbone of apps like Notion, Figma plugins, and countless collaborative tools) don't use wall-clock timestamps at all.

Instead, they use something called **clientID ordering**. Each device gets a random ID when it connects. When conflicts happen, the device with the _higher_ ID wins.

This is confirmed directly by Kevin Jahns (dmonad), the creator of Yjs:

> "The 'winner' is decided by `ydoc.clientID` of the document (which is a generated number). The higher clientID wins."
>
> — [dmonad, GitHub issue #520](https://github.com/yjs/yjs/issues/520)

You can see this directly in the Yjs source code ([updates.js#L357](https://github.com/yjs/yjs/blob/main/src/utils/updates.js#L357)):

```javascript
// From Yjs source - conflict resolution sorting
lazyStructDecoders.sort((dec1, dec2) => {
	if (dec1.curr.id.client === dec2.curr.id.client) {
		return dec1.curr.id.clock - dec2.curr.id.clock; // Same client: higher clock wins
	} else {
		return dec2.curr.id.client - dec1.curr.id.client; // Different clients: higher clientID wins
	}
});
```

```
Alice's laptop: clientID = 500
Bob's phone: clientID = 800

Bob wins. Not because he edited later, but because 800 > 500.
```

But what if:

```
Alice's laptop: clientID = 900
Bob's phone: clientID = 200

Alice wins. Even though Bob edited an hour later.
```

## Why Would Anyone Design It This Way?

Because timestamps are broken in distributed systems. Here's how dmonad explains the design philosophy:

> "Systems for conflict resolution should not rely on time (as in 'wall clock time'). First of all, time is not synced between devices. Secondly, who is to say that changes from desktop client should supersede changes from mobile client just because they happened 'later' (however you wanna measure this)?"

**Clock skew is real:**

- Your laptop might be 5 minutes ahead
- Your phone might be 2 minutes behind
- That VM in the cloud? Who knows

**NTP isn't reliable:**

- Clocks can jump backward during sync
- Offline devices don't sync at all
- Different timezones, different configurations

**The result:** If you use timestamps, Alice's fast clock means she _always_ wins, even when Bob edited genuinely later. That's worse than random.

ClientID ordering is arbitrary, but it's _deterministic_. Every device will converge to the same state. That's the actual goal of CRDTs: convergence, not fairness.

As one community member put it:

> "This is expected behavior. CRDT won't guarantee that result is always correct for each round, it only guarantees result is same for every client."

From the [Yjs INTERNALS.md](https://github.com/yjs/yjs/blob/main/INTERNALS.md):

> "Maps are lists of entries. The last inserted entry for each key is used, and all other duplicates for each key are flagged as deleted."

## But I Really Want "Later Edit Wins"

You can build it yourself. Libraries like `y-lwwmap` add timestamps on top of Yjs:

```typescript
// Each write includes a timestamp
map.set('title', {
	value: 'Final',
	timestamp: Date.now(),
	authorId: myClientId,
});

// On conflict, higher timestamp wins
// Tie-breaker: hash of value (deterministic)
```

**The tradeoffs you accept:**

- Clock skew can still cause "earlier" to win if clocks disagree
- You need tombstones for deletes (30-day retention typical)
- More storage, more complexity
- You're betting your devices have decent clocks

For most apps, this tradeoff is fine. Your users' devices probably have NTP. But now you know it's a _choice_, not a guarantee.

## The Real Solution: Avoid Conflicts

The best conflict resolution is no conflict at all.

Instead of storing a whole object under one key:

```typescript
// BAD: One key for entire field definition
schema.set('title', {
	type: 'text',
	nullable: true,
	default: 'Untitled',
});
// If Alice changes nullable and Bob changes default,
// ONE OF THEM LOSES ENTIRELY
```

Use nested structures:

```typescript
// GOOD: Each property is a separate key
schema.get('title').set('type', 'text');
schema.get('title').set('nullable', true);
schema.get('title').set('default', 'Untitled');
// Alice and Bob edit different keys = no conflict
```

Now Alice's `nullable` change and Bob's `default` change both survive. Conflict eliminated.

## TL;DR

1. **"Last Write Wins" in CRDTs usually means "highest clientID wins"**, not "latest timestamp wins"
2. **This is intentional** because timestamps are unreliable in distributed systems
3. **You can add timestamps yourself** if you accept the clock skew tradeoffs
4. **The best solution is designing your data** so conflicts rarely happen

Next time you're building a collaborative feature, remember: the "last" in Last Write Wins might not be what you think.
