# Root vs Nested: The Two Worlds of `.get()` in Yjs

Yjs has two completely different behaviors hidden behind similar-looking method names. Understanding this distinction is fundamental to working with Yjs correctly.

## The Core Insight

**At the document root, `.getMap()` creates or retrieves a named singleton.**

**Inside a Y.Map, `.get()` returns what's there or undefined.**

These are not the same operation. They're not even close.

## Root Level: Named Singletons

When you call `doc.getMap('name')`, you're not asking "give me whatever Y.Map is stored under this key." You're saying "give me THE Y.Map named 'name' for this document."

```typescript
const doc = new Y.Doc();

// First call: creates the map
const tables1 = doc.getMap('tables');

// Second call: returns the SAME map
const tables2 = doc.getMap('tables');

console.log(tables1 === tables2); // true — same instance
```

The map is created on first access and returned on subsequent access. It's a get-or-create pattern, but more importantly, it's tied to the document's identity.

### This Works Across Clients

Here's where it gets interesting. When two clients both call `doc.getMap('tables')` before syncing:

```
CLIENT A                           CLIENT B
────────                           ────────
doc.getMap('tables')               doc.getMap('tables')
tables.set('posts', ...)           tables.set('users', ...)

                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │    SYNC     │
                    └─────────────┘

AFTER SYNC: Both clients have the SAME Y.Map
            containing both 'posts' AND 'users'
```

The root-level maps **merge**. Yjs recognizes that both clients are referring to the same named singleton. The contents from both clients are combined.

This is what makes root-level shared types "safe" for concurrent creation.

## Nested Level: Standard Lookups

Inside a Y.Map, `.get()` behaves like a normal Map lookup:

```typescript
const tables = doc.getMap('tables');

// This might be undefined
const posts = tables.get('posts');

if (posts === undefined) {
	// The key doesn't exist — nothing was created
}
```

There's no magic here. If the key doesn't exist, you get `undefined`. If it does exist, you get the value.

### Why This Matters for Nested Y.Maps

When you store a Y.Map inside another Y.Map:

```typescript
const tables = doc.getMap('tables');

// Creating a NEW Y.Map and assigning it to a key
tables.set('posts', new Y.Map());
```

You're not creating a "named singleton." You're:

1. Creating a brand-new Y.Map instance
2. Storing a reference to it under the key 'posts'

If two clients do this concurrently:

```
CLIENT A                           CLIENT B
────────                           ────────
tables.set('posts', new Y.Map())   tables.set('posts', new Y.Map())
// A creates YMap-A                // B creates YMap-B

                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │    SYNC     │
                    └─────────────┘

AFTER SYNC: ONE of these Y.Maps wins.
            The other is completely discarded.
```

This is the "nested Y.Map trap" in action. Two different Y.Map instances are competing for the same key. Yjs picks one deterministically. The losing one—and all its contents—is gone.

## The Method Name Confusion

Here's the naming that trips people up:

| Method                 | Context       | Behavior                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `doc.getMap('name')`   | Document root | Get-or-create singleton   |
| `doc.getArray('name')` | Document root | Get-or-create singleton   |
| `doc.getText('name')`  | Document root | Get-or-create singleton   |
| `ymap.get('key')`      | Inside Y.Map  | Return value or undefined |

The `get` prefix suggests the same semantics. They're fundamentally different.

A clearer API might have been:

```typescript
// Root level (hypothetical)
doc.ensureMap('name'); // Creates if missing
doc.ensureArray('name'); // Creates if missing

// Nested level
ymap.get('key'); // Standard lookup
```

But that's not what we have. So we adapt.

## Why Root Level Is Different

From [Yjs INTERNALS.md](https://github.com/yjs/yjs/blob/main/INTERNALS.md), root-level types are special because they're identified by **name** across all clients:

> Each item inserted in a Yjs document is given a unique ID, formed from an ID(clientID, clock) pair.

But root-level types don't follow this pattern. They're identified by their string name, not by client operations. When Client A creates `doc.getMap('tables')` and Client B creates `doc.getMap('tables')`, they're both referring to the same conceptual object—"the tables map for this document."

Nested Y.Maps, by contrast, are regular items with client-specific IDs. When two clients create `new Y.Map()` and assign it to the same key, they've created two different items with two different IDs competing for one slot.

## Practical Implications

### Root Level: Use Freely

```typescript
// These are always safe for concurrent access
const tables = doc.getMap('tables');
const users = doc.getMap('users');
const settings = doc.getMap('settings');
```

Multiple clients can call these methods before syncing. The resulting maps will merge their contents.

### Nested Level: Be Careful

```typescript
// DANGEROUS if two clients might do this concurrently
tables.set('posts', new Y.Map());

// SAFER: Use unique IDs so collisions are impossible
const tableId = crypto.randomUUID();
tables.set(tableId, new Y.Map([['name', 'Posts']]));

// SAFEST: Structure your data so creation happens at root level
// (See "Solutions" in yjs-nested-maps-lww-trap.md)
```

## The Mental Model

Think of it this way:

**Root level**: You're declaring that "this named thing exists in this document." All clients agree on what "this named thing" means.

**Nested level**: You're storing a value at a key. If two clients store different values at the same key, one wins.

The root level is special. The nested level is normal. Don't confuse them.

## Quick Reference

| Question                  | Root Level            | Nested Level            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Method name               | `doc.getMap('name')`  | `ymap.get('key')`       |
| Returns if missing        | New empty shared type | `undefined`             |
| Concurrent creation       | Merges contents       | One wins                |
| Safe for concurrent setup | Yes                   | Only if keys are unique |
| Identity                  | By name               | By client ID + clock    |

## Try It Yourself

Copy this into a file and run with `bun run demo.ts` (requires `yjs` installed):

```typescript
import * as Y from 'yjs';

// Two separate clients
const docA = new Y.Doc();
const docB = new Y.Doc();

// ROOT LEVEL: Both get the "tables" map
const tablesA = docA.getMap('tables');
const tablesB = docB.getMap('tables');

// Each adds different keys
tablesA.set('fromA', 'Alice');
tablesB.set('fromB', 'Bob');

// NESTED LEVEL: Both create a NEW Y.Map at the same key
tablesA.set('posts', new Y.Map([['data', "Alice's posts"]]));
tablesB.set('posts', new Y.Map([['data', "Bob's posts"]]));

// Sync both ways
Y.applyUpdate(docA, Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(docB));
Y.applyUpdate(docB, Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(docA));

// Check results
console.log('Root-level keys:', [...tablesA.keys()]);
// → ["fromA", "fromB", "posts"] — MERGED!

console.log(
	'Nested Y.Map data:',
	(tablesA.get('posts') as Y.Map<string>).get('data'),
);
// → Either "Alice's posts" OR "Bob's posts" — ONE WINS, other is GONE
```

Run it a few times. The root-level keys always merge. The nested Y.Map is always one or the other—never both.

## Summary

1. **`doc.getMap('name')`** is a get-or-create singleton identified by name
2. **`ymap.get('key')`** is a standard lookup that returns undefined if missing
3. Root-level shared types merge across clients
4. Nested shared types compete for map keys—one wins, others are lost
5. The similar naming (`get*` vs `.get()`) obscures this fundamental difference

Understanding this distinction is the key to structuring Yjs documents safely.
