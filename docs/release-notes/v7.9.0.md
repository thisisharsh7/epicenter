# Whispering v7.9.0: Custom Endpoints & New Navigation

You can now connect Whispering to any OpenAI-compatible transcription service, and the app has a completely redesigned sidebar navigation that puts quick settings at your fingertips.

## OpenAI-Compatible API Endpoints

Bring your own transcription server. Whether you're running LocalAI, Ollama, vLLM, or any other OpenAI-compatible service, you can now point Whispering directly at it. Just select "OpenAI-Compatible" as your transcription service and enter your endpoint URL.

Settings → Transcription → Service → OpenAI-Compatible

## New Vertical Navigation

The sidebar is now the default navigation. Quick settings for device, transcription service, and compression are accessible right from the sidebar. It collapses gracefully for more screen space, and you can toggle visibility in Settings → Appearance.

The sidebar defaults to collapsed on first launch for a cleaner initial experience.

## GPT-5 Model Support

GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini are now available as inference model options for transformations.

## Voice Activity Detection Fix

Fixed an issue where VAD could get stuck in an incorrect state after a misfire. The detector now properly resets to LISTENING state.

## Linux Stability Improvements

whisper.cpp on Linux is now more resilient to crashes, with proper panic logging and poisoned mutex handling. This addresses issues some Linux users experienced with transcription failures.

## Performance: Bulk Delete

Deleting multiple recordings is now significantly faster thanks to a single FFI call instead of per-file operations.
