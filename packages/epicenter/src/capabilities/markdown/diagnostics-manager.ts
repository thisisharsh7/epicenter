/**
 * Create a diagnostics manager for tracking markdown validation errors
 *
 * The manager maintains a live index of files that currently fail validation.
 * This is fundamentally different from an append-only log:
 *
 * - **Purpose**: Track current state (which files are broken right now)
 * - **Updates**: Add entries on validation failure, remove when fixed/deleted
 * - **Persistence**: Writes queued and executed sequentially in background
 * - **Lifecycle**: Rebuilt on startup, maintained by file watchers
 *
 * **Data structure**:
 * - In-memory: `Map<AbsolutePath, DiagnosticEntry>` for O(1) operations
 * - On-disk: JSON object keyed by file path for human readability
 *
 * **Non-blocking design**:
 * All mutations (add/remove/clear) are synchronous and return immediately.
 * Disk writes are queued and executed sequentially in the background.
 * This prevents mutations from blocking the caller while ensuring writes
 * happen in order (no race conditions).
 *
 * **Usage pattern**:
 * ```typescript
 * const diagnostics = await createDiagnosticsManager({
 *   diagnosticsPath: '/path/to/diagnostics.json'
 * });
 *
 * // Non-blocking: returns immediately
 * diagnostics.add({
 *   filePath: '/path/to/broken.md',
 *   tableName: 'posts',
 *   filename: 'broken.md',
 *   error: MarkdownCapabilityError({ ... })
 * });
 *
 * // Non-blocking: returns immediately
 * diagnostics.remove({ filePath: '/path/to/broken.md' });
 *
 * // Get current state (reads in-memory map)
 * const allErrors = diagnostics.getAll();
 * console.log(`${diagnostics.count()} files currently invalid`);
 *
 * // Wait for all writes to complete (optional, for testing/shutdown)
 * await diagnostics.flush();
 * ```

 * @param config.diagnosticsPath - Path to diagnostics file (relative or absolute, parent directory created if needed)
