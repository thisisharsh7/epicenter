/**
 * Generator that yields all workspace actions in an Epicenter client.
 *
 * Epicenter has a three-layer hierarchy: Client → Workspaces → Actions.
 * This generator traverses all layers (including nested namespaces) and yields
 * each action with its metadata. The destroy and Symbol.asyncDispose methods
 * at client and workspace levels are automatically excluded.
 *
 * Supports nested exports: actions can be organized in namespaces like
 * `{ users: { getAll: defineQuery(...), crud: { create: defineMutation(...) } } }`
 *
 * @param client - The Epicenter client with workspace namespaces
 * @yields Objects containing workspaceId, actionPath, and action
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Map over actions directly (Iterator Helpers)
 * const toolNames = iterActions(client).map(info => info.workspaceId);
 *
 * // Group actions by workspace
 * const byWorkspace = Object.groupBy(
 *   iterActions(client),
 *   info => info.workspaceId
 * );
 *
 * // Iterate with early break
 * for (const { workspaceId, actionPath, action } of iterActions(client)) {
 *   if (action.type === 'mutation') break;
 * }
 * ```
